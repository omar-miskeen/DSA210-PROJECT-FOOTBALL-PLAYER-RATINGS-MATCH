This study analyzed FC Barcelona's 2024-2025 season to test two primary hypotheses regarding individual player impact and team success. The first hypothesis, that distinct performance metrics drive the match ratings of different players, was strongly validated through correlation analysis. The results successfully isolated specific player archetypes: Lamine Yamal's ratings are uniquely tied to progressive carries, establishing him as a ball carrier, whereas Pedri operates as the engine with ratings defined by progressive passing. Robert Lewandowski was statistically confirmed as a pure finisher whose performance depends almost entirely on non-penalty expected goals, while Raphinha bridges these roles as a hybrid threat. The second hypothesis posited that the aggregated volume of advanced attacking metrics would significantly predict match results. This was largely rejected, revealing a critical consistency paradox. While actual goals scored and average player ratings naturally decline during losses, the team's fundamental creative process, measured by total expected goals and shot-creating actions, remains statistically stable across wins, draws, and defeats. This suggests that dropped points stem primarily from variance in finishing efficiency or defensive instability rather than a failure in attack generation.

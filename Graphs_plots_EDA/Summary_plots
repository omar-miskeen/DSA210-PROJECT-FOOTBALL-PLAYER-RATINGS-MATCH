Exploratory data analysis of FC Barcelona's 2024-2025 season reveals distinct tactical profiles for key attacking players and a stable underlying creative process for the team. Correlation analysis identifies Lamine Yamal as a primary ball carrier, with match ratings driven by progressive carries, whereas Pedri functions as the engine, his performance defined by progressive passes. Robert Lewandowski's ratings are almost exclusively tied to finishing metrics like non-penalty expected goals, while Raphinha emerges as a hybrid threat, contributing significantly to both creation and scoring. At the team level, visual analysis of match outcomes highlights a "consistency paradox": while actual goals and player ratings naturally dip during losses, the team's fundamental creative output—measured by total expected goals and shot-creating actions—remains remarkably stable across wins, draws, and losses, suggesting that dropped points stem more from variance in finishing efficiency than a failure in chance creation.
